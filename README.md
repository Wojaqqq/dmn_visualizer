# Dmn Visualizer

Project developed for the completion of the Master's degree.


## Introduction

The master's thesis aims to explore the feasibility of creating a tool that can reproduce DMN (Decision Model and Notation) decision models from scans or photos. The author focuses on creating a web application that uses object detection and OCR (optical character recognition) technologies to find and interpret DMN notations contained in photos, and then generates the corresponding decision models.


## Setup

Use conda_environment.yaml as a requirement file for creating environment in anaconda. 

```bash
conda env create -f conda_environment.yaml
```

My trained model is not stored in the repository because of its size. You can download it from [this link](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/random_characters/your_model). After downloading, move files to the model directory.

## Example usage
