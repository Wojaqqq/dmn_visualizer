# Abstract

The master's thesis aims to explore the feasibility of creating a tool that can reproduce DMN (Decision Model and Notation) decision models from scans or photos. The author focuses on creating a web application that uses object detection and OCR (optical character recognition) technologies to find and interpret DMN notations contained in photos, and then generates the corresponding decision models.
